Among the various forms of phishing attacks, there\'s one known as \\"SMiShing\\" attacks, which target users through SMS messages.\\n\\n## SMiShing Attacks\\nToday, we\'ve noticed a SMiShing campaign in Kazakhstan, where a seemingly innocent link leads to a fake website that mimics the KazPost website, the official postal service of Kazakhstan. Several indicators set this apart:\\n\\n- The sender\'s country code\\n- The target website\\n- The fact that the package was never ordered\\n\\n![SMiShing Attacks](./post-kz-smishing.jpg)\\n\\nThe provided link directs users to a phishing page designed to imitate post.kz, the official website of the postal service in Kazakhstan.\\n\\n## Recommendation\\nWe strongly advise against responding to such SMS messages. If you have any doubts or concerns, it\'s best to contact your nearest post office to clarify the details, especially if you did not order a package that coincides with the SMS.\\n\\n## Taking Action\\nRest assured that we\'ve promptly added this resource to our shared blocklists and locked it within the OpenBLD DNS system. Your online safety is our top priority.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nIn these times of increasing digital threats, let\'s remain vigilant and protect ourselves and our online experiences. \\nTogether with OpenBLD.net DNS, we can strive for a safer online environment.

OpenBLD.net, the service committed to minimizing the internet noise caused by advertising and tracking, has evolved to introduce cutting-edge features like Anycast/GeoDNS, DNSSEC, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNS-over-TLS.\\n\\n## New Features\\nThis evolution has brought forth two new services: Adaptive (ADA) and Strict (RIC), which are set to replace A-BLD and BLD. But what sets them apart? It\'s time to find out.\\n\\n## Testing Phase\\nI\'ve been testing these new services for over two weeks now, and I must say, they are impressive. For all OpenBLD users, I encourage you to give them a try. Here\'s how you can make the switch:\\n\\n- For DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), replace `https://a-bld.sys-adm.in/dns-query` with `https://ada.openbld.net/dns-query`\\n- For DNS-over-TLS (DoT), switch from `a-bld.sys-adm.in` to `ada.openbld.net`\\n\\n- For DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), replace `https://bld.sys-adm.in/dns-query` with `https://ric.openbld.net/dns-query`\\n- For DNS-over-TLS (DoT), switch from `bld.sys-adm.in` to `ric.openbld.net`\\n\\nIn a week or two, A-BLD will be fully merged with ADA, ceasing to exist as we know it. One server (109.234.39.72) will be replaced by another (46.151.29.15) for faster and more efficient service. Don\'t wait; start your testing today!\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\nAll of this growth and development would not have been possible without the incredible support we\'ve received this year.
