[OISD](https://oisd.nl/) it is one of better projects aimed to reduce internet noise. You can use OISD for own purposes, 
in your DNS server, or you can [use](/docs/get-started/third-party-filters/oisd/) it in OpenBLD.net as a ready-made solution.

## What is this [oisd](https://oisd.nl/) blocklist?

The blocklist prevents your devices from connecting to unwanted or harmful domains. It reduces ads, 
decreases the risk of malware, and enhances privacy. You can see FAQ and other details on the official [OISD website](https://oisd.nl/).

## How to use OISD in OpenBLD.net?

You can use OISD without exclusions, without additional blocklist - just only OISD in OpenBLD.net as DoH 
link in `RIC` mode.

See details in [Docs](/docs/get-started/third-party-filters/oisd/). Happy Internet surfing! ✌️
