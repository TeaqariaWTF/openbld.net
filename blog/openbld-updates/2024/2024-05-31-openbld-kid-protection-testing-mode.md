👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 OpenBLD.net - Caring for Children

Understanding that advertisements are junk information for a child's brain, I also recognize that "adult content" is even more unacceptable for minors.

This includes:

- Pornography
- Escort services
- Gambling

Starting today, I'm launching a new server in test mode with filtering for this type of content.

- DoT settings: `kid.openbld.net`
- DoH settings: `https://kid.openbld.net/dns-query`

If the testing is successful, the service will be integrated into the overall OpenBLD.net ecosystem.

Protect your younger generation. And of course, stay [connected](/docs/contacts).

Peace to everyone ✌️
