New [OpenBLD.net](https://openbld.net/) points of presence have been added in the world thanks to [AlphaVPS.com](https://alphavps.com/clients/aff.php?aff=657)!

[AlphaVPS.com](https://alphavps.com/clients/aff.php?aff=657) - Fast & Cheap VPS, Cloud Servers and few servers from AlphaVPS 
stay which located in **Bulgaria** and **Germany** joined in to OpenBLD.net ecosystem.

As you know one of the our prioritites - fast DoH/DoT responses and _1GBit/s_ from AlphaVPS it is good base for this requirements.

One server already available for users (see [status](https://bld-status.sys-adm.in/) of Ada-h4), 
second server will be available in the next few days. Enjoy it üöÄ 

P.S. Few times ago I posted OpenBLD.net [IPv6 Pre-Release](../2023/2023-12-11-openbld-ipv6-pre-release.md) notice, in few near weeks I'll plan implement 
DoH/DoT IPv6 for users in Europe, I'll tell about this later üòé...
