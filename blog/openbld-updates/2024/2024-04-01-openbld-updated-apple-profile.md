![OpenBLD.net Update Profile for Apple Devices](images/openbld_apple_profile_update.png)

Following recent attacks on one of the hosting providers within OpenBLD.net, I have updated the server topology to optimize content delivery, especially for Apple users.

Download the optimized profile from the project website and simply install it over your existing one:

- Setup Mobile Devices > [Apple](/docs/get-started/setup-mobile-devices/apple/)

If your system is functioning normally, updating is not mandatory. Just remember that the option is available. Peace! ✌️

P.S. If you have any questions regarding the update - [Welcome](/docs/contacts) 😎
