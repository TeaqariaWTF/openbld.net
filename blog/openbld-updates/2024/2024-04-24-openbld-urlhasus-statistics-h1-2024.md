OpenBLD.net outperformed AdGuard, Cloudflare, Quad9 in blocking malware domains!

### Background

Some time ago, OpenBLD.net was [added](2024-03-11-openbld-abuse-ch-integration.md) to the [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) project. URLhaus is a project operated 
by [abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/) with the goal of sharing and preventing malicious URLs that are being used for malware distribution.

The ecosystem of the service, based on the [philosophy](/docs/intro/#philosophy) of blocking internet noise, has demonstrated excellent protection against malicious domains and intrusive ads. 💪

### What now

According to URLhaus statistics, OpenBLD.net surpasses giants like AdGuard, Cloudflare, and Quad9 in blocking malware and unwanted domains. 🛡️

OpenBLD.net doesn't just offer protection - it creates a sense of security for your online space.

Your [donations](/docs/donation/) and [sponsorship](/docs/sponsorship) can help us become even better and ensure the stable development of the service.

### What's next?

Join OpenBLD.net today, and together we'll make the internet safer and quieter!

Peace ✌️
