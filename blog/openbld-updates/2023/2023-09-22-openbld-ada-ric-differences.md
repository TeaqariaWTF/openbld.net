What's the Difference Between Ada and Ric OpenBLD.net?

- 🌟 **Ada** - Adaptive DNS: Harmoniously filters malicious content and ensures seamless internet connectivity whenever possible
- 🚫 **Ric** - Strict DNS: Blocks many marketing and tracking resources, which may affect access to certain internet content

I recommend **Ada** for most OpenBLD.net DNS users. [Get-Started](/docs/category/get-started).
