## Upcoming Changes in OpenBLD.net

As time progresses and the user base grows, server capacities are expanding, necessitating more servers and funds. However, the budget is already allocated and distributed.

In light of the above, some changes are planned for the architecture of OpenBLD.net:

- **ADA (DNS 53):** Disable everywhere except for the main two or three servers
- **RIC (DNS 53):** Eliminate DNS 53 on all RIC servers, leaving only - DoT, DoH.

In summary: DNS 53 will remain only in the ADA infrastructure.

**Important:** Please let me know if this may break something for you; we will think together about what can be done.

Anyone who can contribute to the OpenBLD.net project, please don't hesitate. You can find information on how to do this and the benefits you can expect [here](/docs/donation/).

ü§ù Thanks to everyone who has helped and continues to help. Blessings to you all!
