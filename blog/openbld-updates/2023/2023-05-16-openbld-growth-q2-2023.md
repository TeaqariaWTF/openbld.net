## Introduction
In the ever-evolving OpenBLD ecosystem, the second quarter of 2023 has witnessed remarkable growth and some exciting changes. OpenBLD.net, the service committed to minimizing the internet noise caused by advertising and tracking, has evolved to introduce cutting-edge features like Anycast/GeoDNS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNS-over-TLS.

## New Features
This evolution has brought forth two new services: Adaptive (ADA) and Strict (RIC), which are set to replace A-BLD and BLD. But what sets them apart? It's time to find out.

## Testing Phase
I've been testing these new services for over two weeks now, and I must say, they are impressive. For all OpenBLD users, I encourage you to give them a try. Here's how you can make the switch:

- For DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), replace `https://a-bld.sys-adm.in/dns-query` with `https://ada.openbld.net/dns-query`
- For DNS-over-TLS (DoT), switch from `a-bld.sys-adm.in` to `ada.openbld.net`

- For DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), replace `https://bld.sys-adm.in/dns-query` with `https://ric.openbld.net/dns-query`
- For DNS-over-TLS (DoT), switch from `bld.sys-adm.in` to `ric.openbld.net`

In a week or two, A-BLD will be fully merged with ADA, ceasing to exist as we know it. One server (109.234.39.72) will be replaced by another (46.151.29.15) for faster and more efficient service. Don't wait; start your testing today!
