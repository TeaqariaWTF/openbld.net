## Introduction
In Almaty, this Thursday, October 19, at 7:00 PM in SmartPoint, I'll be presenting an open report on the topic of "Security and DNS."

## The Importance of DNS
We all recognize that DNS is the backbone of the internet; without it, nothing would function properly. It's everywhere, yet its significance in cybersecurity often goes unnoticed.

## What to Expect
While the document is still a work in progress, I plan to cover the following key areas:

- Why DNS is crucial and how it operates
- Its impact on security
- How it affects users
- DNS and Threat Intelligence
- The origins of OpenBLD.net DNS üò°
