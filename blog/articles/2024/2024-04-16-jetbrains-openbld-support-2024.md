![JetBrains OSS OpenBLD.net support](images/jetbrains-openbls-support-2024.png)

JetBrains, following [open source support](https://www.jetbrains.com/opensource/) practices, has supported OpenBLD.net and me this year with a new license.

JetBrains was the first company to support my initiative in creating my open projects. Such support has been significant for me, my motivation, and moving forward. Thanks to such activities, you understand that you're not wasting time, that you're not pulling it all alone, there are those who understand you, who support you and your ideas, and this makes you even stronger and closer to achieving your goals and realizing your ideas.

It's cool, it's nice, and it gives the opportunity to move even further than you are today.

To everyone who has the opportunity to help people and projects in their development and support and does so - this is dedicated. Success to all of us! Peace
