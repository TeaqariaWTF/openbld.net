Few time ago I decided to move OpenBLD.net content from Nuxt3 to a Docusaurus blogging system.

Before I used Nuxt3 for the [Sys-Adm.in Labs](https://lab.sys-adm.in/) blog which also hosted the 
main docs for the OpenBLD.net ecosystem infrastructure. Begin with current day, I decided to move main
content to the Docusaurus blogging system on relevant OpenBLD.net domain.

Docusaurus it is a best choose for OpenBLD.net Service Project. With [Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog),
we can use markdown files (or folders) in to the `blog` directory.

Thanks, Docusaurus, for this functionality and flexible content management system!
