Few time ago I decided move OpenBLD.net content from Nuxt3 to Docusaurus blogging system.

Docusaurus it is a best choose for OpenBLD.net Service Project. With [Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog),
we can use markdown files (or folders) in to the `blog` directory.

Thanks, Docusaurus, for this functionality and flexible content management system!
