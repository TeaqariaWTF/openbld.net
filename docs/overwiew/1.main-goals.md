# Main Goals

A few years ago, the OpenBLD.net DNS service was launched into open access. 
The service was originally introduced as Open BLD Sys-Admin DNS Service. 
Over time, it was decided to rename the service to OpenBLD.net since this name and domain are more consonant with the project's name.

## Goals List
- Reducing the likelihood of information threats
- Minimum operations related to installing additional software
- Reducing the load on memory, processor, and network
- Fast DoH/DoT DNS responses
- Accelerating the loading of web pages
- Concentration on target information, without being distracted by advertising
- Reduced heat generation from the computer and its power consumption
- Blocking adware, spyware, malware, phishing, tracking, telemetry, analytics, ads, banners, popups, etc.
