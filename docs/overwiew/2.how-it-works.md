# How it Works

OpenBLD DNS is a multi-compatible, simple, fast service with in different locations of the world. OpenBLD DNS it is a open DNS service.
- **Easily** - Simple using without software installations. OpenBLD works in several modes - Adaptive (ADA), Strict (RIC), [OpenBLD+](4.openbld-plus.md).
- **Multi-compatible** - Enough to configure the private settings of the browser, mobile device (Android 9+, iOS 14+ are supported) or configure OpenBLD DNS on a home or office router and feel the "OpenBLD effect" üå±

# Operating Modes

- **Adaptive (ADA)** - Recommended for most users
- **Strict (RIC)** - Recommended for advanced users
- **OpenBLD+ (BLD+)** - Personal support. [Get more details](4.openbld-plus.md).

:::tip
**[OpenBLD Plus](4.openbld-plus.md)** - This includes personal support, no limits on redundant requests, analysis of security or technical incidents, and alerting. It is provided based on monthly donations in the amount of $3+ or similar in any other currency. 
See details [here](4.openbld-plus.md).

### ADA vs RIC

The key difference between ADA and RIC in OpenBLD DNS is that ADA allows various services such as Yandex, TikTok, Facebook, etc. By "various services," we mean services for managing marketing cabinets or business tools.

#### What Does ADA Allow?

- Social media tools (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.)
- All Yandex tools (Alice, Kinopoisk, etc.)
- All Google tools
- Advertising links from search results
- Etc.

ADA is an OpenBLD "add-on," adapted and suitable for most users of the OpenBLD DNS service.

#### OpenBLD Processing

OpenBLD uses a granular approach. If ADA allows, for example, all Yandex resources, 
then RIC allows key services (for example: mail, passport, money, etc.). In simple terms, RIC is a more "strict" service which can affect some Internet services.

#### Providing Feedback

Both services use different regular expressions and DNS lists, which are periodically maintained. Allowing lists are formed thanks to your feedback.

Feedback on the health and debugging of lists and sites you can be sent through [Contacts](/docs/contacts.md) page.

## Locations

- **Europe (Netherlands, Germany)**
- **Asia (Kazakhstan)**
- **Japan (Tokyo)**

:::tip
Some servers, rarely, but may change IP addresses. 
All changes are usually reported in the official Telegram channel of the project cee [Contact](/docs/contacts.md) for more details.
:::

## Connectives

OpenBLD.net supports IPv4 and IPv6 (testing) and can be used in different ways:

- DoH - `https://ada.openbld.net/dns-query` or `https://ric.openbld.net/dns-query`
- DoT - `ada.openbld.net` or `ric.openbld.net`
- **IPv4** - `Under Maintenance` if you really need IPv4 addresses, please contact us through [Contacts](/docs/contacts.md) page.

See more details how to setup your devices on [Where to start](/docs/get-started/where-to-start/) page.

:::tip
Preferred way to use DoH or DoT.
IP addresses can be changed in the future, keep this in mind before setting up your DNS.
:::

## Limitations

You can use OpenBLD.net as regular DNS service, but it has some limitations:

- Without special requests, such as AXFR, ANY etc.
- Without brute-force domain or subdomain names, etc.
- Without abuse of the service.
- Without any other malicious activity.
- No more than 100 requests per second from one IP address.

Otherwise, your requests and IP addresses can be blocked, if this happens by mistake or you suspect that malicious activity 
has appeared on your network, or if you have any questions, please contact us through [Contacts](/docs/contacts.md) page 
or try to get [OpenBLD Plus](4.openbld-plus.md) service.

## Exceptions

:::tip
OpenBLD does not cover YouTube.
