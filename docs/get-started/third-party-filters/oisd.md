# OISD

## What is this [oisd](https://oisd.nl/) blocklist?

The blocklist prevents your devices from connecting to unwanted or harmful domains.
It reduces ads, decreases the risk of malware, and enhances privacy.

## Use OISD on OpenBLD.net (RIC)

You can use [OISD](https://oisd.nl/) in OpenBLD.net as `DoH` link in `RIC` mode:

```shell
https://ric.openbld.net/dns-query/oisd
```

:::tip
- [OISD](https://oisd.nl/) is used as is - without exclusions, without additional blocklist - just only OISD.
- OpenBLD.net uses a "small" list of OISD, which is updated every 1 hour.
