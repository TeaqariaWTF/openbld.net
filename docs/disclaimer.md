**Additional Information**

- It is a hobby project, maintained through personal activities and resources (such as time and money).
- I and the testing team, as users of this service, envision a cleaner internet with a focus on information rather than malicious content.
- This service is supported by me and donations and is maintained as much as possible but has no Service Level Agreement (SLA) — keep this in mind when using these services.
- The project does not cover YouTube resources.
